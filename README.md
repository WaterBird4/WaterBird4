- 👋 Hi, I’m @WaterBird4
- 👀 I’m interested in everything! Python has been my go to language for the past 2 years. I love JavaScript as well, but I'll admit I'm a bit rusty with not writing much lately.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about cyber security and hardware 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate: I love new challenges and projects. If you have an idea and think I can help, please reach out.
